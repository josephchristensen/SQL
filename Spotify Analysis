# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Next I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#After creating the Spotify Data table I thought of some questions I could answer you the data available to me.

#What artist has the most popular song and what is the name of that song?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
LIMIT 1;

#What are the top five artists with the highest average song popularity and average song danceability of at least 65?

SELECT artist_name AS artist, ROUND(AVG(popularity),1) AS avg_popularity, ROUND(AVG(danceability*100),1) AS avg_danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING avg_popularity >=90
AND avg_danceability >=65
LIMIT 5;
